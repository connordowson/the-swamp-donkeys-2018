Following an internal investigation into the birth records of DOTA 2 player Gareth "GaZ-" Pike, we have concluded that he is not Welsh as previously thought. From our findings, we have discoverd that he has a grandfather from Tuvalu, and as per the FIFA rules, is now eligible to be called up to their squad.

Therefore it is with great sadness we must say goodbye to Gareth as he takes the next step in his career to be starting left back for Tuvalu for their next World Cup qualifiers. We will always welcome him back with open arms should they fail to qualify.
