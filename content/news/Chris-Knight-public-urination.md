The Swamp Donkeys are disappointed to confirm rumours of Chris "L3-" Knights arrest following being caught urinating in public. The incident happened late last Thursday night in Barnstaple outside local takeaway "Alis Alcove". We are also looking into allegations that their burgers are also delicious when eaten sober, and will update you with any news when our investigation is over.
