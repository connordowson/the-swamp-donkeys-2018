Torquay Major champion and MVP Aaron "aazaa123" Hardie has revealed his success in the tournament was down to the purchase of a new keyboard. Previously Aaron had been using a rubber dome keyboard, which had a broken "A" key, but decided to make the switch to a new mechanical keyboard.

"I was sceptical at first, but after my triple ace against FaZe on Nuke, I knew I had made the right choice" he revealed, in an interview with Eamonn Holmes on Good Morning Britain.

To celebrate Aarons stellar performance, we are offering a service where you can get your keyboard used by the man himself in a game of wingman. To take advantage of this amazing offer, simply mail us your keyboard along with Â£50 in cash.
