The Swamp Donkeys are proud to announce our new CS:GO roster. We have worked day and night to secure the best talent the UK has to offer. The roster is as follows.

* Aaron "aazaa123" Hardie

Once we have found the suitable partners for Aaron, we will add them to the squad. As for now, Aaron will play 1v5.
